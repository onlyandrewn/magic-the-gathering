                    <p class="article__text">For a new generation of players picking up Magic: The Gathering, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jLrrAfGaUo">complexity is a hurdle</a> that needs to be overcome before a person can even start playing the game.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="article__text">But having a game that involves a lot of strategy isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it may be what is attracting new players to the game in the first place. Magic's player base tripled in the two years prior to the pandemic.</p>
                        
                    <p class="article__text">As the oldest trading card game in the world is set celebrate its 30th birthday, many Magic players have asked the question: Is the game becoming too complex?</p>
    
                    <p class="article__text">For this analysis, we looked at the length of card text, card art and frequency of set releases using the <a href="https://scryfall.com/">Scryfall API</a>, which contains data on every card in Magic's history — more than 23,000 in total — as a way to measure complexity.</p>

                    <h2>An ever expanding card pool</h2>

                    <p class="article__text">The two most popular formats in Magic are "Standard" which includes roughly 2,000 cards from the most recent sets. Cards rotate in and out of the format once a year.</p>
                    
                    <p class="article__text">The other is "Commander," where players have access to the entire card pool of more than 23,000 unique cards dating all the way back to the game's inception.</p>

                    <p class="article__text">Two years ago, the game introduced "showcase frames" which are variations of cards with a dramatically different art style — adding to the game's visual complexity.</p>
                    
                    <p class="article__text">Since March 2020, there have been <span class="highlight">587 cards with showcase frames</span> released.</p>
    
                    <p class="article__text">As the game continue grows, the creators of the Magic understand the need to make the game accessible to newer players.</p>
                    
                    <p class="article__text">Complexity helps to keep the game fresh and exciting as the design of the game ventures to new planes, introduces new abilities and adds new characters.</p>
                    
                    <p class="article__text">For formats such as Commander, where the card pool does not rotate, the complexity of the game will inevitably continue to grow.</p>
